#### What is Arduino?

Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on Processing.

## Getting Started

First of all the Arduino software is easy-to-use for beginners, yet flexible enough for advanced users. It runs on Mac, Windows, and Linux (I really prefer Linux, its so good). Teachers and students use it to build low cost scientific instruments, to prove chemistry and physics principles, or to get started with programming and robotics.

In this project i used one Arduino [Uno R3](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-uno-rev3)

##### Install the Arduino IDE:

The first step to programming is install the Arduino IDE.

Its very simple, look the [site](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) have a excellent tutorial to you learn step by step, how you install the IDE.

#### Download of libraries you need.

After you install the IDE you need to import the library, in this project i used the [VirtualWire](http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/VirtualWire/VirtualWire-1.27.zip) the documentation you find in this [link](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_VirtualWire.html).

I used the VirtualWire library to facilitate the implemented of the **RF 433Mhz transmitter-receiver Module**

#### The list of materials you need to create the same projecti is:

- 2 - Arduino Uno R3;
- 1 - Protoboard;
- 1 - RF 433Mhz transmitter-receiver Module;
- 2 - Battery 9V (Optional);
- 2 - Adpters to battery (Optional);
- 1 - Resistor of 220 Ohms;
- 1 - LED PTH
- 12 - Jumpers;
